# freeCAD
Welcome to my FreeCAD repository on GitHub. This repository stores all files that I am using on my video tutorials on the free and Open Source CAD software FreeCAD.
You can find exercises in PDF file format and example files (solutions) in the .fcstd file format (FreeCAD standard file format for parts).
