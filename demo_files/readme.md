## Demo Files
### Rounded Hexagon (abgerundetes Rechteck)
File: _fc019_DEMO_rounded_hexagon.FCStd_
Created after a user request. The user wanted to create a hexagon with rounded corners. The demo file is created by a sketch in the XY plane containing a simple hexagon shape. The fillets have been created after this in the 3D view by using the fillet feature.
